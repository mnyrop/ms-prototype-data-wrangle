  "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 9/25/2023 Entry Certificates and Visas for the United Kingdom The holders of entry certificates or visas which are still current will be presumed by the immigration officer in the United Kingdom to be eligible for admission unless he discovers:- (a) that false representations were employed or mate- rial facts were concealed, whether or not to the holder's knowledge, for the purpose of obtaining the entry certificates or visas; or (b) that a change of circumstances after issue has removed the basis of the holder's claim to ad- mission; or (c) that the holder should be refused admission on grounds of restricted returnability, on medical grounds, on grounds of criminal record, because he is subject to a deportation order or because exclusion would be conducive to the public good. 2. If you hold a \"visit\" entry certificate or visa, it is advisable for you to produce an onward or return ticket to the immigration officer on arrival in the United Kingdom to facilitate immigration clearance. Director of Immigration, Hong Kong. I.D. 240"
