Updated affidavit of support of Marie Magny. 2. Updated affidavit of support of Pierre Magny. 3. Letter of Employment of Pierre Magny. 4. Letter of Employment of Marie Magny. 5. Statements Relating to Enrollment Investment Plan at Honeywell of Pierre Magny. 6. Verification of Bank Account at Shawmut Bank. 7.
