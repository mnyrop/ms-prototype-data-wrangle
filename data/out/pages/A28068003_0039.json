  "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 4/24/2023 Use InfoPass for Appointments. As an alternative to waiting in line for assistance at your local USCIS office, you can now schedule an appointment through our internet-based system, InfoPass. To access the system, visit our website at www.uscis.gov. Use the InfoPass appointment scheduler and follow the screen prompts to set up your appointment. InfoPass generates an electronic appointment notice that appears on the screen. Print the notice and take it with you to your appointment. The notice gives the time and date of your appointment, along with the address of the USCIS office. Reporting Burden. An agency may not conduct or sponsor an information collection and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. We try to create forms and instructions that are accurate and easily understood, and that impose the least possible burden on you to provide us with information. Often this is difficult because some immigration laws are very complex. Accordingly, the reporting burden for this collection of information is computed as follows: 1) learning about the form, 30 minutes; 2) completing the form, 60 minutes; and 3) assembling and filing the application, 30 minutes, and an estimated average of 120 minutes per response. If you have any comments regarding the accuracy of this estimate or suggestions for making this form simpler, write to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Regulatory Management Division, 111 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20529, OMB No. 1615-0060. Do not mail your completed application to this address. Form N-648 Instructions (Rev 01/13/06)Y Page 3"
