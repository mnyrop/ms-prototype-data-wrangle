  "full_text": "ROBERT E. DOROUGH DISTRICT CLERK FANNIN COUNTY BONHAM, TEXAS 75418 May 4, 196 8 45 AM 1967 IMMIGRATIONS Mr. Billy K. Chapman General Attorney United States Dept. of Justice Immigration and Naturalization Service Houston, Texas Re: Josef Tiras Dear Mr. Chapman: I was unable to find the above referred to information the first time because the matter was not indexed. It also appears that some of the records concerning Declaration of Intentions have been lost. By going page by page in the minute book and using your information, I found a judgment. I have not found all the information required because I am unable to locate the papers. The manner in which papers were filed in 1892 requires one without any index memoranda to go file by file to locate it. If you write me it is necessary to find the original petition and any other papers that might be filed in the case, I will do so on your notice. Even the fee and docket book for this time has been lost and I am not aware what papers were filed in this case. Sincerely, Robert E. Dorough RED:fs"
