  "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 4/24/2023 (3) The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to any person who is unable, because of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment or combination of impairments which has lasted or is expected to last at least 12 months, to demonstrate an understanding of the English language as noted in paragraph (a) of this section. The loss of any cognitive abilities based on the direct effects of the illegal use of drugs will not be considered in determining whether a person is unable to demonstrate an understanding of the English language. For purposes of this paragraph, the term medically determinable means an impairment that results from anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities which can be shown by medically acceptable clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques to have resulted in functioning so impaired as to render an individual unable to demonstrate an understanding of the English language as required by this section, or that renders the individual unable to fulfill the requirements for English proficiency, even with reasonable modifications to the methods of determining English proficiency as outlined in paragraph (c) of this section. Title 8, Code of Federal Regulations, ยง 312.2, states, in pertinent part: (a) General. No person shall be naturalized as a citizen of the United States upon his or her own application unless that person can demonstrate a knowledge and understanding of the fundamentals of the history, and of the principles and form of government, of the United States. A person who is exempt from the literacy requirement under ยง 312.1(b)(1) and (2) must still satisfy this requirement. (b) Exceptions (1) The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to any person who is unable to demonstrate a knowledge and understanding of the fundamentals of the history, and of the principles and form of government of the United States because of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, that already has or is expected to last at least 12 months. The loss of any cognitive skills based on the direct effects of the illegal use of drugs will not be considered in determining whether an individual may be exempted. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term medically determinable means an impairment that results from anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities which can be shown by medically acceptable clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques to have resulted in functioning so impaired as to render an individual to be unable to demonstrate the knowledge required by this section or that renders the individual unable to participate in the testing procedures for naturalization, even with reasonable modifications. On December 8, 2008 and February 22, 2010 you submitted Forms N-648 for Agency consideration (Medical Certification for Disability Exceptions). The first adjudicating officer reviewed your N-648 and determined that you are not eligible for an exception, and requested additional information with regard to your N-648. The second adjudicating officer reviewed your second opinion and determined your N-648 insufficient. The doctor diagnosed you to have heart disease, arthritis and limited vision. These conditions are not considered to be qualifying disabilities as stated in the Code of Federal Regulations 312.2(b). Furthermore, he did not explain in detail the connection between the findings and your inability to learn English and U.S. history and civics. For the above reason(s), you are deemed ineligible for an exception from the requirements of section 312 of the INA. Accordingly, your application may not be approved, and is hereby denied."
