  "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 8/11/2023 Use the table below to compute your dependents' coverage. Find your spouse's age group, then match it with the ap- propriate number under \"Spouse's Coverage.\" Multiply that number by your annual base rate of pay. The example shows that for an employee who makes $13,000 and whose spouse is age 25, the amount of coverage is $13,000. Each child's coverage is equal to .25 of the employee's pay, which in this example is equal to $3,250. Age of Spouse's Coverage Child's Coverage Spouse (multiple of employee's pay) Under 30 1.00 x 13,000 = $13,000 .25 X $13,000 = $3,250 30-34 .90 .25 35-39 .80 .25 40-44 .70 .25 45-49 .60 .25 50-64 .50 .25 65 and over .40 .25 Cost Your cost for Dependent Life Insurance is .20% of your monthly base rate of pay up to a maximum of $30 per month. Your monthly base rate in pay is your basic monthly salary or wage, including any sales or executive incentive pay, but not including overtime, shift premium, bonuses, or other forms of extra income. In the example above, the employee's cost for Dependent Life coverage is $2.17 per month. Payment of Benefits In the event of the death of one of your covered dependents, the full amount of his or her coverage will be paid to you in one lump sum.
