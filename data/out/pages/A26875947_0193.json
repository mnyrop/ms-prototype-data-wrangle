The notification, a copy of which is en- closed, states that you did not at any time receive documen- tation which had been previously requested. On August 7, 1987 I wrote a letter to travel control requesting additional time to submit the requested information. On October 6, 1987, when all the requested information was available, I wrote a letter to Travel Control enclosing the requested documentation. Copies of my letters are en- closed. In addition, the Motion to Reconsider contained other documentation in response to your earlier concerns. I am, therefore, asking that your recent decision be recon- sidered. If it is necessary for me to resubmit any of the documents mentioned above please let me know. Thank you for your consideration. Very truly yours, Gerald D. Wall Attorney GDW/mg Enclosures"
