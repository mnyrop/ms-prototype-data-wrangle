  "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 5/5/2023 532 EL SALVADOR The Constitution permits employment of children less than 16 years. old only in those cases where their employment is necessary to provide for their subsistence or the subsistence of their families. Children less than 18 years old are prohibited from legally working at night or in dangerous occupations. The reality, however, is that teenage and even younger children work long hours. The minimum wage for workers in the industrial and service sectors is about US$3.10 per day. In practice, the salaries of most workers in these sectors is above the minimum wage. These workers are paid overtime for working more than \" hours in a week and are entitled to 15 days of annual paid vacation. The minimum wage for farm workers is about US$1.08 plus about US$ worth of food per day. Farm workers are paid more during harvest times. The national commission on minimum salaries has proposed an increase for farm workers over 16 years old and an additional increase for those partially incapacitated or under 16. The proposal has not been acted on. The piece rates paid at harvest times not workers triple or quadruple the minimum wage. The Government requires that work sites be safe, and that drinking water, toilets, and adequate ventilation be provided workers. Major industrial enterprises generally meet these requirements. Between June 1984 and May 1985, the labor ministry made 467 inspections and studies of working conditions, initiated four campaigns aimed at preventing work related accidents, held four seminars on occupational safety and hygiene, and investigated 319 work-related accidents. The Labor Ministry carries out inspections either at its own initiative or on the basis of & complaint. However, the Labor Ministry complains that budgetary restrictions and guerrilla activities, such as the destruction of Labor Ministry vehicles, impede full enforcement of worker laws. Under the Constitution women enjoy the same legal rights as men. Three women serve as deputies in the 60-member assembly, and about ten percent of the mayors elected in March 1985 are women. Women hold positions as vice ministers of culture, economics, education, interior, foreign commerce, and justice. Most elementary school teachers, nurses, and secretaries are women, as well as about 50 percent of the teachers on the high school level and between 30 to 60 percent of university professors, Womon also play & role in private industry, especially as owners of small enterprises. Several major companies are owned and operated by woman. Women serve on the boards of directors of several banks. Women are also well represented in the professions: about 30 percent of the physicians, 50 percent of the dentists and more than 30 percent of the attorneys are women. They are members of the Armed Forces as nurses, in administrative areas, and in intelligence, The National Police is training women us detectives and has & corps of policewomen. A high proportion of woman in the lower economic strata are heads of single parent households, often providing for large families. Seventy percent of the children in E1 Salvador are born out of wedlock, and most of those are not legally recognized by their fathers even when occupying the same domicile."
