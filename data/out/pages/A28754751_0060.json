The rest are generally able to support their members, but the majority are unable to make debts. payments on their land debt or 1980-1981 emergency credit The 1983 Constitution clarified Phase II of the reform by establishing a ceiling of 245 hectares (605 acres) that an individual may own and by giving affected owners three years to sell property in excess of that limit to peasants, small farmers, or peasant organizations. The state can expropriate any excess land not disposed of by December 1986. Twelve to 15,000 hectares of land are affected by Phase II and the Ministry of Agriculture is beginning to develop necessary implementing legislation. Under Phase III of the reform, farms previously rented or sharecropped could be claimed in parcels of up to seven hectares (17.3 acres) by the former renters or sharecroppers, including family members. Under Phase III more than 300,000 Salvadorans have been moving towards ownership of the land they work. Many landowners affected by Phase III resisted strongly, some with violence, and forced eviction of beneficiaries. Many others filed legal protests with the Government; and at one point in 1984 about 20 percent of the legal challenges to Phase III claims were being decided in favor of the original landowner on the basis that the applicant for the land did not qualify under Phase III rules. Currently, there is less legal activity, and peasant organizations report that forced eviction is no longer a significant problem. In 1984 the infant mortality rate was 67 per 1,000 live births, and life expectancy was 64.5 years The per capita caloric intake was 92 percent of nutritional requirements.
