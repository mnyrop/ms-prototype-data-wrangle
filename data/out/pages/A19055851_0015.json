  "full_text": "INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS 1. APPLICATION-FORM N-585. Persons desiring a search of the records of this Service shall submit this application executed as fully as possible. The specific purpose for which information is desired must be set forth. 2. CONSENT REQUIRED. The subject of a Service record may consent in writing to another person's obtaining information to which the subject would be entitled. A block is provided in the application form where such consent is shown. Information from visa petitions may be furnished upon application of the pe- titioner or beneficiary but an application by a third person requires the petitioner's written consent. 3. FEES. (a) Basic Charges. A single fee of $3.00 shall be charged for a search of the records of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The fee is required for the search and is not returnable. When the information requested relates to two or more persons, groups, or things, the search for each is a separate service and an additional fee or fees shall be submitted. In addition fees are chargeable for searching time or for monitoring time as prescribed by 8 CFR 103.7. Searching time, generally, is considered as covered by the basic fee of $3.00; however, additional charges shall be imposed for unusual requests that result in expenditure of considerable time. Charges for monitoring shall be assessed when the requester's examination requires assignment of an employee specifically for that purpose. (b) Copies and Certifications. A fee of 25 cents per page, with a minimum fee of 50 cents, shall be paid for copies of Service records but no charge (other than the basic search fee of $3.00) shall be required for the first page of a record. An additional fee of $1.00 is required for each certification of a true copy, with or without seal. For each attestation under seal an additional fee of $3.00 is required. The attestation is made by typing \"A COPY. ATTEST:\", and placing under this the signature and title of the attesting officer and affixing the seal. (c) Manner of Submission. If this application is mailed DO NOT SEND CASH. Attach a check or a United States postal money order (or, if outside the United States, an international money order) made pay- able to \"Immigration and Naturalization Service, Department of Justice.\" An applicant residing in the U.S. Virgin Islands shall make his remittance payable to \"Commissioner of Finance of the Virgin Islands\" and if residing in Guam to \"Treasurer, Guam.\" 4. CERTIFICATION OF NATURALIZATION RECORDS. A certification of any part of a court naturalization record, or of any certificate of naturalization or citizenship, may be obtained if required for compliance with any law, or if needed in any judicial proceeding. Application for such certification should include a statement of the relevant statute, or the nature of the judicial proceedings and the court in which pending. 5. NATURALIZATION RECORDS. If naturalization occurred prior to September 27, 1906, the subject's place of residence at the time of naturalization must be furnished. Such records rarely contain information regarding members of the naturalized person's family. 6. ARRIVAL RECORDS. Records of arrival prior to July 1, 1924 do not contain birthdates but merely show age stated at time of entry. 7. CERTIFICATE OF BIRTH DATA FROM IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION RECORDS. A certification of birth data from the records of this Service may be issued to foreign-born children under twenty-one years of age for a fee of $3.00. The parent, guardian or other adult having a legitimate interest in a person who is under fourteen years of age may file an application on such person's behalf.
