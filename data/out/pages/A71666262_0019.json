BOX 30137 APO NY 09675 NAIROBI, KENYA Dear MAHAMED SHIDE BARAF 23 MAR 95 Date FOIA (b)(6) A- 71 666262 We regret that we are unable to approve your application for refugee resettlement admission to the United States. To be resettled in the United States as a refugee, an applicant must meet the statutory definition of refugee contained in section 101 (a) (42) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), as amended. Refugee status can be approved only if the applicant establishes a credible claim of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Additionally, all applicants for refugee status in the United States must establish that they are not precluded from entry into the United States under other sections of law. During your interview with an Officer of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), your claim to having been persecuted or having a well-founded fear of persecution was reviewed. At that time, you were given the opportunity to present evidence, documentation, and/or an accumulation of detail through verbal testimony of the events or circumstances which support you claim of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution. After carefully reviewing your account of these events and surrounding circumstances, it has been determined that you do not qualify for refugee status because of the reason(s) checked below: The events, action (s) and surrounding circumstances set forth by you in your application and developed during the interview do not constitute persecution within the meaning of U.S. immigration law. The events, action(s) and surrounding circumstances set forth by you in your application and developed during the interview do not support your claim of a well-founded (i.e., \"reasonable\") fear of persecution within the meaning of U.S. immigration law. You have not established that the actions taken against you, or those which you fear may be taken against you due to your race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion."
