Nelson. 727 F. 2d 957, 967-68 (11th Cir. 1984), cert. granted, 53 USLW 3417 (U.S. December 4, 1984). IV. CUSTOMARY GRANTING OF CHANGE OF VENUE \"Almost invariably, the hearing is held in or near respondent's area of residence If the respondent (s) moves to another area before the hearing commences, or even after it is under way, it is customary to transfer the proceedings to the immigration district near his new home.\" Gordon and Rsoendfeld 5-73 The immigration judge may change venue of the hearing pursuant to 8 C. F. R. 242.8 (a) Matter or Seren, Int. Dec. 2472 and Matter of K--, 5 I & N Dec. 347, Matter of Smith, 16 I & N Dec. 147 (BIA 1977) at 149 states \"Ordinarily, the better procedure would be to hold the hearing in the district of the alien's residence or place of arrest. La Franca vs. INS. 413 F. 2d 686 (2d Cir. 1969)\" Other factors that designate the proper venue are: the location of witnesses, the office location of the alien's lawyer who has detailed knowledge of the case and the alien's opportunity to establish his cooperation with the government in criminal prosecution. Matter of Smith, at page 150 quoting Chlomos V. U.S. Department of Justice, a516 F. 2d 310 (3rd Cir. 1975). V. CHANGES OF PROCEDURES:"
