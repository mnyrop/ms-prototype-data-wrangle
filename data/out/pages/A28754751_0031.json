  "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 5/5/2023 Neither the Immigration and Naturalization Service nor the Executive Office for Immigration Review has made public or published any proposed changes or actual changes in the regulations, Operating instructions or other agency policy directives to authorize what apparently is a policy decision whose actual effect is to render changes of venue to Los Angeles much more difficult to obtain. VI. CONCLUSION: The respondent meets all the usual criteria for a change of venue to Los Angeles. Residence has been established in Los Angeles. Respondent is seventy three years old (73), and therefore is very difficult for him to travel. Respondent's attorney who is familiar with the case is located in Los Angeles. Respondent has stated in the Motion for Change of Venue that witnesses are located in Los Angeles, regarding eligibility for discretionary relief. Further, expert witnesses and bodies of documentation that may be needed are only known to be available in Los Angeles. The Immigration and Naturalization Service is prejudiced little if it all by the change of venue. Respondent has already admitted the allegations and conceded deportability based on the previous court practice of allowing for change of venue if deportability was conceded and the sole purpose for the continuance of the hearing was for the purpose of application for discretionary relief."
