When grant of permanent residence becomes final, the copy returned by the Visa Control Office which allocates the visa number shall be appropriately endorsed, and placed in the filé. In such cases the triplicate copy, which was retained in the file, shall be noted to show the date permanent residence status is granted and forwarded to the State Director of Selective Service in the case of every male alien born on or after September 15, 1925, and who has reached 18 years of age. If not required for this purpose, it shall be destroyed. In cases where permanent residence is granted without referral to the Visa Control Office, except where Selective Service is to be notified, only an original 1-181 need be prepared and placed in the file. In other cases where outstanding instructions require the form -181 to be forwarded to the Visa Control Office, it shall be prepared in dup- licate and the original placed in the file, except when an additional copy is required to notify Selective Service. DISTIBICI PREFERENCE: Under Section 245, the priority date will be the filing date of one of the first six preference petitions. ACTION NONPREFERENCE: Under Section 245, the priority date shall be fixed by the following factors, whichever is the earliest; (1) the priority date accorded the applicant by the consular officer as a nonpreference immigrant; (2) the date on which application Form 1-485 is properly filed, if the applicant establishes that he is a member of a profession or a person with exceptional ability in the sciences or the arts not included in the Department of Labor's Schedule A (29 CFR 60) provided a certification is issued on that basis, or that he is within Schedule A, or that the provisions of Section 212(a)(14) of the Act do not apply to him; (3) the date on which an ap- proved valid third or sixth preference visa petition in his behalf was filed; or (4) the date an application for certification based on a job offer was accepted for processing by any office within the employment service system of the Department of Labor, provided the certification applied for was issued. A nonpreference priority date, once established, is retained by the alien even though at the time a visa number becomes available and he is allotted a nonpreference visa number he meets the provisions of Section 212 (a) (14) of the Act by some means other than that by which he originally established entitlement to the nonpreference priority date. LABOR CERTIFICATION: Check and complete the block regarding certifications on the form as appropriate in a nonpreference case.
