When grant of permanent residence becomes final, the copy returned by the Visa Control Office which allocates the visa number shall be appropriately endorsed, and placed in the filé. In such cases the triplicate copy, which was retained in the file, shall be noted to show the date permanent residence status is granted and forwarded to the State Director of Selective Service in the case of every male alien born on or after September 15, 1925, and who has reached 18 years of age. If not required for this purpose, it shall be destroyed. In cases where permanent residence is granted without referral to the Visa Control Office, except where Selective Service is to be notified, only an original 1-181 need be prepared and placed in the file. In other cases where outstanding instructions require the form -181 to be forwarded to the Visa Control Office, it shall be prepared in dup- licate and the original placed in the file, except when an additional copy is required to notify Selective Service. DISTIBICI PREFERENCE: Under Section 245, the priority date will be the filing date of one of the first six preference petitions. ACTION NONPREFERENCE: Under Section 245, the priority date shall be fixed by the following factors, whichever is the earliest; (1) the priority date accorded the applicant by the consular officer as a nonpreference immigrant; (2) the date on which application Form 1-485 is properly filed, if the applicant establishes that he is a member of a profession or a person with exceptional ability in the sciences or the arts not included in the Department of Labor's Schedule A (29 CFR 60) provided a certification is issued on that basis, or that he is within Schedule A, or that the provisions of Section 212(a)(14) of the Act do not apply to him; (3) the date on which an ap- proved valid third or sixth preference visa petition in his behalf was filed; or (4) the date an application for certification based on a job offer was accepted for processing by any office within the employment service system of the Department of Labor, provided the certification applied for was issued. A nonpreference priority date, once established, is retained by the alien even though at the time a visa number becomes available and he is allotted a nonpreference visa number he meets the provisions of Section 212 (a) (14) of the Act by some means other than that by which he originally established entitlement to the nonpreference priority date. LABOR CERTIFICATION: Check and complete the block regarding certifications on the form as appropriate in a nonpreference case. S-S REMARKS: If the visa number requested is based on Section 202(b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) or Section 203(a)(9) of the Act explain as appropriate in \"Remarks\" block INCTS DELAY NOTICE: When the Service a visa number from the Department of State before granting permane interesident the letter portion of this form notifying of the delay is mailed to the applicant with copy to the attorney of record. In represented cases the attorney are is notified of the approval of an application by furnishing him with a copy of the notice which is part of this form. pc VIA 230 833 MAC STR blace OE CREVIION Ot RECORD RESIDENCE 26LAICE ONILED OE Inclice"

Mail the original and one copy to the Visa Control Office When grant of permanent residence be- comes final, the copy returned by the Visa Control Office which allocates the visa number shall be appropriately endorsed, and placed in the file. In cases where permanent residence IS granted without réferral to the Visa Control Office only an original - -181 need be prepared and placed in the file. In other cases where outstanding instructions require the Form 181 to be forwarded to the Visa Control Office, it shall be prepared in dupli cate and the original placed in the file. OH Jala PREFERENCE: Under Section 245, the priority date will be the filing date of one of the first six preference petitions. NONPREFERENCE Under Section 245, the priority date shall be fixed by the following factors, whichever is the earliest; (1) the priority date accorded the applicant by the consular officer as a nonpreference immigrant; (2) the date on which application Form 1-485 is properly filed, if the applicant establishes that he is a member of a profession or a person with exceptional ability in the sciences or the arts not included in the Departn ent of Labor's Schedule A(29 CFR 60) provided a certification is issued on that basis, or that he is within Schedule A, or that the provisions of Section 212(a)(14) of the Act do not apply to him; (3) the date on which an ap- proved valid third or sixth preference visa petition in behalf was filed; or (4) the date an application for certification based on a job offer WIU accepted for processing by any office within the employment service system of the Depa nent of Labor, provided the certification applied for was issued. A nonpreference priority date, once established, is retained by the alien even though at the time a visa. number becomes available and he is allotted a nonpreference visa number he meets the provisions of Section 212(a)(14) of the Act by some means other than that by which he originally established entitlement to the nonpreference priority date. LABOR CERTIFICATION: Check and complete the block regarding certifications on the form as appropriate in a nonpreference case. REMARKS: If the visa number requested is based on Section 202(b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) or Section 203(a)(9) of the Act explain as appropriate in \"Remarks\" block. DELAY NOTICE: When the Service must obtain a visa number from the Department of State before granting permanent residence, the letter portion of this form notifying of the delay is mailed to the applicant with a copy to the attorney of record. In represented cases the attorney is notified of the approval of an application by furnishing him with a copy of the notice which is part of this form. presson CO' SPEST WASHINGTON LIVIT' FIEM III TRU UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Immiaration and Naturalization Service"

She test that she dad departed from the U.S. sometime in 1933 and returned to the U.S. on 11/8/59. She stated that this absence was onlt to her native country of Ireland. App test that she had never voted in a foreign election, had never worked for a foreign government, had never served in the Armed Forces of a foreign country, had never taken an oath of allegiance to a foreign country, and had never obtained foreign natz. The State Dept file in her visa file ( A 10 775 863 ) reflects that App was held to have expatriated due to foreign residence. The U.S. Supreme Court in Schneider V. Rusk in May of 1964 held this to be unconstitutional. As no other grounds for expatriation is indicated, it appears that App has not been expatriated. In accordance with instructions contained in NE Memo of 7/9/64, a new N.C. was issued. App subsequently married and has surrended her old cert and a new one in her marriage was issued her this day.

Mrs. Margaret O'Neill, 829 Hyde Park Avenue, Hyde Park, Boston 36, Mass. Dear Mrs. O'Neill: The receipt is acknowledged of your letter dated June 22, 1964, requesting the Embassy to forward to you the certificate of loss of United States nationality in your case, which contains information regarding your acquisition of American citizenship. Your citizenship file at this office shows that you were naturalized before the Supreme Court of the State of New York at Long Island City, New York, on November 30, 1932, in your maiden name, Margaret Horgan. Certificate of Naturalization number 3645015 was issued to you. You were issued passport number 30184 in your maiden name, by the Department of State on June 8, 1933. You lost your American nationality under Section 404(b) of the Nationality Act of 1940 by residing continuously in Ireland, the country of your birth, for a period of three years. The effective date of loss was October 15, 1946. A certificate of loss of nationality in your name, dated, July 30, 1957, was approved by the Department of State on August 13, 1957. A copy of the approved certificate of loss was forwarded to you from the American Consulate at Cork on September 3, 1957. The Embassy does not, therefore, have a copy to forward to you at this time. In view of the recent decision made by the Supreme Court of the United States in the Schneider v.Rusk case, it appears that you may regain your American citizenship. It is believed that the information contained in this letter will be of assistance to you in this matter. Sincerely yours, For the Charge d'Affaires a.i., theore American Kiyonao Consul Okami Heame"

When grant of permanent residence becomes final, the copy returned by the Visa Control Office which allocates the visa number shall be appropriately endorsed, and placed in the file. In such cases the triplicate copy, which was re- tained in the file, shall be noted to show the date permanent residence status is granted and for- warded together with completed Form I-59 to the State Director of Selective Service in the case of every male alien between the ages 18 and 26 or between the ages of 18 and 35 in the case of a doctor, dentist or other medical specialist. If not required for this purpose, it shall be destroyed. In cases where permanent residence is granted without referral to the Visa Control Office, except where Selective Service is to be notified, only an original 1 - 181 need be prepared and placed in the file. In other cases where outstanding instructions require the form 1 - 181 to be forwarded to the Visa Control Office, it shall be prepared in duplicate and the original placed in the file, except when an additional copy is required to notify Selective Service. PREFERENCE: Under Section 245, the priority date will be the filing date of one of the first six preference petitions. NONPREFERENCE: Under Section 245, the priority date shall be fixed by the following factors, whichever is the earliest; (1) the priority date accorded the applicant by the consular officer as a nonpreference immigrant; (2) the date on which application Form 1-485 is properly filed, if the applicant establishes that he is a member of a profession or a person with exceptional ability in the sciences or the arts not included in the Department of Labor's Schedule A(29 CFR 60) provided a certification is issued on that basis, or that he is within Schedule A, or that the provisions of Section 212(a)(14) of the Act do not apply to him; (3) the date on which an ap- proved valid third or sixth preference visa petition in his behalf was filed; or (4) the date an application for certification based on a job offer was accepted for processing by any office within the employment service system of the Department of Labor, provided the certification applied for was issued. A nonpreference priority date, once established, is retained by the alien even though at the time a visa number becomes available and he is allotted a nonpreference visa number he meets the provisions of Section 212(a)(14) of the Act by some means other than that by which he originally established entitlement to the nonpreference priority date. LABOR CERTIFICATION: Check and complete the block regarding certifications on the form as appropriate in a nonpreference case. REMARKS: IF the visa number requested is based on Section 202(b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) or Section 203(a)(9) of the Act explain as appropriate in \"Remarks\" block. DELAY NOTICE: When the Service must obtain a visa number from the Department of State before granting permanent residence, the letter portion of this form notifying of the delay is mailed to the applicant with a copy to the attorney of record. In represented cases the attorney is notified of the approval of an application by furnishing him with a copy of the notice which is part of form. yelco TOOS CUTCHEO"
