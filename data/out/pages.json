It is further understood and agreed that if the said alien from time to time visits foreign territory contiguous to the United States and is permitted after inspection by a United States Immigration Officer to return to the United States prior to final departure as required by this obligation, such absence shall not be construed to discharge or in any manner relieve the obligor from the conditions, liabilities and obligations of this bond. (2) BOND CONDITIONED FOR THE DELIVERY OF AN ALIEN In consideration of the granting of the application of the above alien for release from custody under a warrant of arrest issued by the Attorney General charging that he/she is unlawfully in the United States, provided there is furnished a suitable bond as authorized by sec- tion 242 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the obligor hereby furnishes such bond with the following conditions: if said alien is released from custody and if the above mentioned obligor shall cause the said alien to be produced or to produce himself/herself to an immigration officer of the United States upon each and every request of such officer until deportation proceedings in his/her case are finally terminated or until the said alien is actually accepted by such immigration officer for detention or deportation, then this obligation shall be void; otherwise it shall immediately become due and payable; Provided, that it is hereby specifically agreed by the obligor that no order issued by or under the authority of the Attorney General by virtue of which issuance or execution of any order of deportation is or may be deferred, or by virtue of which the said alien is or may be permitted to depart from the United States, shall be in any manner con- strued to impair or render void this obligation or any part thereof. (3) BOND THAT ALIEN SHALL NOT BECOME A PUBLIC CHARGE In consideration of the granting of the application of the above alien for permission to enter the United States, provided there is fur- nished a suitable bond that he/she will not become a public charge, the obligor hereby furnishes such bond with the following conditions: If said alien is admitted to the United States and within five years of admission is supported at public expense, whatever the cause may be and whether it arises prior to or subsequent to arrival of said alien in the United States, the obligor shall pay to the United States, or to any State, Territory, county, town, municipality, or district thereof, by whom said alien shall have been supported, any or all charges or ex- penses arising therefrom. The obligor is not relieved from this undertaking if the public authority supporting the alien is not authorized to accept reimbursement or fails to make a demand therefor; the obligor agrees that in such event he/she promptly will pay the actual ex- penses to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. If the obligor fails, within thirty (30) days after notice to him/her by the public authority which has supported the alien at public expense, or within thirty (30) days after notice to him/her by the Service that the alien has been supported at public expense, to pay all charges or expenses as aforesaid, then this obligation shall immediately become due and payable in the total sum of such charges or expenses plus five hundred dollars ($500), provided that in no event shall the liability of the obligor exceed the total amount of the bond. Any such amounts collected by the Service which are not turned over to the public authority supporting the alien will be deposited in the Treasury of the United States. Notwithstanding any violation of this bond and any payment made pursuant to the terms thereof, this obligation shall remain in full force and effect as to the remainder of the liability of this obligation until the bond may be cancelled or until such time as the alien may depart permanently from the United States or become a naturalized citizen thereof or until 5 years following his/her admission have passed; and it is further agreed that suit to enforce any of the conditions of this bond may be instituted for and on behalf and in the name of the United States and to the use of any interested State, Territory, county, town, municipality, or district thereof. (4) BOND FOR RELEASE OF ALIEN UNDER EXCLUSION PROCEEDINGS In consideration of the granting of the application of the above named alien for release from custody subsequent to his/her exclu- sion from admission to the United States or pending the final disposition of his/her application for admission to the United States, provid- ed there is furnished a suitable bond that he/she will deliver himself/herself into the custody of an immigration officer on demand, the obligor hereby furnishes such bond with the following conditions: If said alien is released from custody and if the above obligor shall cause the said alien, as frequently as required, to be delivered to an immigration officer, until such time as said alien is finally admitted to or finally departs from the United States and proof satisfactory to the immigration officer of such departure is made, or such alien is final- ly accepted by such officer for detention of deportation, then this obligation shall be void; otherwise it shall immediately become due and payable, provided, that no order issued under the authority of the Attorney Genera! by virtue of which the said alien is or may be granted additional time to comply with terms of his/her release, or by virtue of which execution of an order of deportation is or may be deferred, or by virtue of which the said alien is or may be permitted to depart voluntarily from the United States, shall be in any manner construed to impair or render void this obligaiton or any part thereof. However, if it is ordered that said alien be admitted temporarily to the United States as a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15) of the Immigration and Nationality Act on the condition that there be furnished a suitable bond in the same sum as specified in block (C), the obligor agrees that in such event he/she shall be bound in accordance with the conditions set forth in paragraph No. (1) captioned \"Bond for Maintenance of Status and Departure of Nonimmigrant Alien\" H. SUBSTITUTION OF SECURITY The obligor hereby deposits security of equal value, described hereunder, in substitution for the security hereinbefore pledged.

VI. CONCLUSION: The respondent meets all the usual criteria for a change of venue to Los Angeles. Residence has been established in Los Angeles. Respondent is seventy three years old (73), and therefore is very difficult for him to travel. Respondent's attorney who is familiar with the case is located in Los Angeles. Respondent has stated in the Motion for Change of Venue that witnesses are located in Los Angeles, regarding eligibility for discretionary relief. Further, expert witnesses and bodies of documentation that may be needed are only known to be available in Los Angeles. The Immigration and Naturalization Service is prejudiced little if it all by the change of venue. Respondent has already admitted the allegations and conceded deportability based on the previous court practice of allowing for change of venue if deportability was conceded and the sole purpose for the continuance of the hearing was for the purpose of application for discretionary relief."

I was born on April 28, 19/5 in a place called Soyapango, Department of San Salvador, El Salvador. I was raised there also. I used to work as a gardener for the IVU (Instituto de Vivienda Urbana), the Institute of Urban Housing. I worked for this institute for 25 years. I retired in 1985. Groups of guerrillas used to come right on the propery of the IVU to do military training. They regularly conducted training and exercises there, including the explosion of small bombs they threw. Guerrillas came to hide at this place very often whenever there was a confrontation. The IVU workers were afraid to tell the police because the guerrillas had threatened to kill us if we did. Someone finally told them and since 1985 the Civil Defense began coming to guard the institute. Guerrillas came to the major stores in Colonia Guadalupe, Soyapango to steal food, money and whatever they could find. I was a member of the volunteer Civilian Patrols for 25 years. The guerrillas have threatened to kill Civilian Patrol volunteers. Many current and former members of the Civilian Patrols have been killed by the FMLN guerrillas in El Salvador. One friend of mine, Santos Navidad, with whom I served on the Patrulla Civil, was killed by the guerrillas a few years ago, dragged out of his home and murdered. Others were killed too, although I don't remember their names. I declare under penalty of perjury that the above said is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. X Pruder cio 6 Seas"

Political Killing The number of politically-motivated killings continues to decline from the levels of previous years. In 1983, according to reports in the San Salvador press, there was an average of 140 politically motivated deaths a month; in 1984 the average was 64; from January to November of 1985 it was 29 per month. One legacy of E1 Salvador's history of political killing is that criminal deaths are often disguised to appear politically motivated in order to avoid correct attribution. Often it is impossible to determine the real motive. While many unexplained deaths are undoubtedly politically motivated, others are the result of criminal or personal motivations. By some estimates, the FMLN-FDR was responsible for approximately 55 percent of the political killings from January through November. Figures for the 318 political deaths during this period, as taken from the local press and other sources, show 145 deaths (45.6 percent) by guerrillas and another 31 possibly by guerrillas, 12 possibly by the extreme right, three by the civil defense, nine by security forces/army, 77 by unknown assailants, and 41 civilians killed in action. During 1985, FMLN-affiliated terrorist groups stepped up individual and collective assassinations, especially in urban areas. For example, the Clara Elizabeth Ramirez Front (CERF), a dissident group of the FMLN, publicly claimed responsibility for four murders in the first two weeks of January. On February 28, guerrillas attacked the residence of the President of the Central Elections Council, killing two of his bodyguards, a street vendor, and a passerby. In March, the Popular Revolutionary Army (ERP) of the FMLN claimed responsibility for a rocket attack on National Police Headquarters in San Salvador which killed one civilian and wounded eight others. The CERF assassinated the Armed Forces press spokesman on March 7. On April 8, 20 residents of Santa Cruz Loma, La Paz department were killed by guerrillas. The victims included six members of one family, three of them children, who burned to death when the attackers doused their house with kerosene and set it afire. Thirteen unarmed members of the Civil Defense forces were assassinated during this raid. Leaflets left at the scene claimed responsibility for the massacre on behalf of the Popular Liberation Forces (FPL) of the FMLN. In May, the FMLN killed the Mayor of San Jorge San Miguel, while attempting to kidnap him. On May 16, the FMLN also assassinated the military judge handling the cases of those accused of subversion, sabotage, and attempting to overthrow the Government. On June 19, the Revolutionary Workers' Party of Central America (PRTC) of the FMLN opened fire on a crowded sidewalk restaurant in San Salvador, killing 13 and wounding 12. Among those killed were four unarmed U.S. Embassy Marine"

In practice, it is impossible to say how many arrests are not based on reasonable cause, as even dismissal of charges at the investigative level often reflects ineffective investigation or is a matter of convenience in an overburdened judicial system. Salvadoran arrest procedures require prisoners to be taken directly to the brigade or police headquarters and registered. For the most part, the police and Armed Forces have complied with this regulation. However, there continue to be some charges of prisoners being taken to unofficial interrogation sites before entering a penal institution. Once registered in a detention center, arrestoos can be held for eight days before they can be visited by the ICRC, CDH, and Tutela Legal. Under Decree 50, arrestoos must be released or consigned to a military investigative\" judge within 15 days of arrest. Many prisoners are released during this initial phase, after preliminary interrogation and investigation. If consigned to a judge, arrestees must be informed of the charges against them within 15 days of consignment. Once they are so informed they have a right to legal counsel. The investigative judge must reach a decision within 60 days of receiving the case. If the case has merit, he sends it to the military judge of the First Instance (the actual trial judge) Decree 50 requires the First Instance judge to hand down is decision within 43 days of receiving the caso. In practice, few cases are handled so quickly; Decree 50 cases usually stay on schedule until they reach the First Instance court, and remain at that stage for an indefinite period. Processing of Decree 50 cases was halted in May 1985, when guerrillas assassinated the sole First Instance Judge handling those cases. The judge was replaced in July and adjudication of cases resumed. As of the and of September, about 500 persons held under Decree 50 were awaiting trial, about the same number as a year previously. Between January and November of 1985, 30 persons were convicted under Decree 50 and seven were acquitted. Charges were dismissed in 113 other cases. In cases of common crime, police may detain a suspect up to 72 hours before presenting him to an investigative judge for release or detention for further investigation. In theory, the investigational phase may not last more than 87 days, subject to extension for investigation. In practice, those time limitations are not always followed; the backlog of cases in the system is the major reason for delay. There are no legal provisions for exile, or for the revocation of citizenship. The Government prohibits forced labor. However, leftist guerrillas have subjected kidneped Salvadoran peasants to forced labor.

Also, intimidation of judges and juries by members of the Armed Forces frequently overcomes prosecution efforts made by the Attorney General's Office. No military officer has been successfully prosecuted for human rights violations in recent years. An ongoing prosecution, however, is that of Captain Eduardo Avila in connection with the murder of a Salvadoran labor leader and two U.S. advisors in January 1981. The Attorney General plans to present additional evidence implicating Avila before the courts to supplement that which was presented in June 1985. A lower court and an appeals court determined that the initial evidence was insufficient to warrant prosecution of Avila. f.

Like the president, they are directly elected. Nine political parties, ranging from the moderate left to the conservative right, participated in the March 31, 1985 legislative and municipal council elections. Five political parties gained representation in the legislature. The Christian Democratic Party (PDC) of President Jose Napoleon Duarte won 52 percent of the vote and captured 33 of the 60 seats in the Legislative Assembly: The National Republican Alliance (ARENA) and the National Conciliation Party (PCN) captured 30 percent and 8 percent of the vote, respectively, and earned 13 seats and 12 seats in the assembly, divided according to a coalition agreement between them. The remaining two seats in the assembly were. won by two smaller parties. The PDC won in.153 of the 262 municipalities; the ARENA-PCN coalition in all but one of the others. Mayors and municipal councils were also elected directly in the March elections for the first time since 1977. Though the PDC has a plurality in the Legislative Assembly, debate in the Assembly is vigorous. The Assembly has altered bills submitted. by the President before passing them, and the President has veteed bills passed with the support of his party' deputies. The Constitution requires the legal recognition of all political parties that do not advocate armed opposition, provided they are able to meet the required minimum membership standards of 3,000 followers. Several small political parties, while not represented in the legislature or municipal councils, do have legal status and freely organize and publish their views. The right to membership in any legally recognized political party is unrestricted. Two opposition parties of the left, the National Revolutionary Movement (MNR) led by Guillermo Ungo. and the communist National Democratic Union (UDN), are Legally recognized but have chosen not to participate in legitimate political activity. The MNR and UDN, together with the Popular Social Christian Movement (MPSC), make up the Democratic Revolutionary Front (FDR), the political front which, in alliance with the FMLN, is waging the insurgency. The Government and the majority of the constitutional opposition have expressed support for the integration of the armed leftist groups into the system as peaceful, legal political parties. As in previous years, the guerrillas sought to disrupt the vote during the elections held in 1985. In the weeks prior to the elections, the guerrillas burned more than 25 municipal buildings. They proclaimed a national traffic stoppage three days before the elections in an attempt to prevent citizens from traveling to vote. On election eve, they mined several rural roads in Chalatenange Department, killing or injuring several civilians on their way to the polls. In spite of these efforts, approximately 1.2 million voters went to the polls, representing more than 65 percent of the electorate. Elections were carried out on site in all but 20 of the 262 municipalities in E1 Salvador. Elections in those 20"

Almost universally, the 130 international observers declared the elections to be open, honest, and a valid demonstration of the popular will. A pastoral letter issued by the Salvadoran bishops on August 8 described the Government as \"a constitutional government, the fruit of a democratic process, sanctioned by the massive turnout at the polls in four successive elections. Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights: The Government maintains an open door policy toward human rights delegations. Key members of the Government, including high-ranking members of the military, have demonstrated their willingness to brief human rights groups and to be interviewed by them. Among those groups which have sent delegations to E1 Salvador are: American Watch, the Faculty for Human Rights in E1 Salvador - Contral America (FHRES), the Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights, U.S. congressional delegations, and various church and labor groups. Physicians from \"Medical Aid for E1 Salvador\" were given access to guerrilla leader Maria Valladares de Lemus (Nidia Diaz), to evaluate her condition and performed an operation on her injured arm. In March, Americas Watch assigned a representative to E1 Salvador who does not permanently reside in the country but does make extended visits. The Government has welcomed the frequent visits of the representatives of the ICRC and human rights groups to prisoners at brigade headquarters and penal institutions. The U.N. General Assembly's Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in E1 Salvador made his fifth annual visit to the country in September and received from each ministry and autonomous agency of the Governent a report on human rights within its area of responsibility. During his visit, the rapporteur interviewed government officials, visited prisoners hold by the Government on charges of subversion, and spoke with representatives of official and nonofficial human rights organizations. In his report to the U.N. General Assembly on November 5, 1985, the rapporteur noted that, \"As in previous years the cooperation by the Government of E1 Salvador was and full and open.\" There are several domestic human rights organizations which are active in E1 Salvador, The official Human Rights Commission (CDH) in un autonomous government agency which investigates complaints of human rights abuse.

The rest are generally able to support their members, but the majority are unable to make debts. payments on their land debt or 1980-1981 emergency credit The 1983 Constitution clarified Phase II of the reform by establishing a ceiling of 245 hectares (605 acres) that an individual may own and by giving affected owners three years to sell property in excess of that limit to peasants, small farmers, or peasant organizations. The state can expropriate any excess land not disposed of by December 1986. Twelve to 15,000 hectares of land are affected by Phase II and the Ministry of Agriculture is beginning to develop necessary implementing legislation. Under Phase III of the reform, farms previously rented or sharecropped could be claimed in parcels of up to seven hectares (17.3 acres) by the former renters or sharecroppers, including family members. Under Phase III more than 300,000 Salvadorans have been moving towards ownership of the land they work. Many landowners affected by Phase III resisted strongly, some with violence, and forced eviction of beneficiaries. Many others filed legal protests with the Government; and at one point in 1984 about 20 percent of the legal challenges to Phase III claims were being decided in favor of the original landowner on the basis that the applicant for the land did not qualify under Phase III rules. Currently, there is less legal activity, and peasant organizations report that forced eviction is no longer a significant problem. In 1984 the infant mortality rate was 67 per 1,000 live births, and life expectancy was 64.5 years The per capita caloric intake was 92 percent of nutritional requirements. The Government conducted a vaccination campaign in early 1985 to and immunize young children against polio and other diseases, followed it with an oral rehydration therapy education campaign of to reduce the number of deaths from diarrhea.

Some 15 percent of the primary school age population are not attending school.

In April 1985 the Government initiated a $150 million, three-year program to renovate primary school clawsrooms and purchase textbooks and other school supplies."

Children less than 18 years old are prohibited from legally working at night or in dangerous occupations. The reality, however, is that teenage and even younger children work long hours. The minimum wage for workers in the industrial and service sectors is about US$3.10 per day. In practice, the salaries of most workers in these sectors is above the minimum wage. These workers are paid overtime for working more than \" hours in a week and are entitled to 15 days of annual paid vacation. The minimum wage for farm workers is about US$1.08 plus about US$ worth of food per day. Farm workers are paid more during harvest times. The national commission on minimum salaries has proposed an increase for farm workers over 16 years old and an additional increase for those partially incapacitated or under 16. The proposal has not been acted on. The piece rates paid at harvest times not workers triple or quadruple the minimum wage. The Government requires that work sites be safe, and that drinking water, toilets, and adequate ventilation be provided workers. Major industrial enterprises generally meet these requirements. Between June 1984 and May 1985, the labor ministry made 467 inspections and studies of working conditions, initiated four campaigns aimed at preventing work related accidents, held four seminars on occupational safety and hygiene, and investigated 319 work-related accidents. The Labor Ministry carries out inspections either at its own initiative or on the basis of & complaint. However, the Labor Ministry complains that budgetary restrictions and guerrilla activities, such as the destruction of Labor Ministry vehicles, impede full enforcement of worker laws. Under the Constitution women enjoy the same legal rights as men. Three women serve as deputies in the 60-member assembly, and about ten percent of the mayors elected in March 1985 are women. Women hold positions as vice ministers of culture, economics, education, interior, foreign commerce, and justice. Most elementary school teachers, nurses, and secretaries are women, as well as about 50 percent of the teachers on the high school level and between 30 to 60 percent of university professors, Womon also play & role in private industry, especially as owners of small enterprises. Several major companies are owned and operated by woman. Women serve on the boards of directors of several banks. Women are also well represented in the professions: about 30 percent of the physicians, 50 percent of the dentists and more than 30 percent of the attorneys are women. They are members of the Armed Forces as nurses, in administrative areas, and in intelligence, The National Police is training women us detectives and has & corps of policewomen. A high proportion of woman in the lower economic strata are heads of single parent households, often providing for large families. Seventy percent of the children in E1 Salvador are born out of wedlock, and most of those are not legally recognized by their fathers even when occupying the same domicile."

One of the topica we discussed related to the present situation of Salvadorians. As you are aware, in situations of large- scale influx it is frequently impracticable to resort TO an indivi- dual determination of refugee status due to the large numbers involved and also to the frequent necessity to provide assistance and protection on an emergency basis. In order 10 overcome these various difficulties, recourse has frequently been had TO what is known as \"prima facic group determination\". This is based on the assumption that in view 01 the conditions prevailing in the country of origin, all members of the group should, in the absence of clear indications to the contrary, be regarded as refugees. As regards persons who have left Salvador after the outbreak of the Civil War early in 1980, we considered that the above-mentioned conditions are indeed fulfilled. Concerning Salvadorians who have left their country prior to the outbreak of the Civil War, it is possible that a number of them may be exposed to serious danger in the event of their returning to their country of origin, 2 matter which would need to be examined in the light of the circumstances of the particular case. Ag far as resettlement is concerned, we were happy to meet Mr. W.K. Bell last month who estimated that Canada would be able 20 receive several hundred Salvadorean refugees this year not including Mr. C. Cram Chairman, Standing Conference of Canadian Organizations Concerned for Refugees 600 Jarvia St."

Dorchester, MA. 02124 APR 15 1986 Dear Mrs. Petit: On December 3, 1985 you filed this Motion to Reconsider your application for adjustment of status to permanent resident (Form I-485) which was denied on November 8, 1985. Within your submission you sent Form I-601 \"Application for Waiver of Grounds of Excludability\" on account of visa fraud pursuant to Section 212 (a) (19) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Your waiver application will be rejected and processed for a refund as you are not \"otherwise admissible\" as required by Section 212 (i) of the Act. Your application for permanent resident on reconsideration is, however, denied again under Section 212 (a) (15) of the Act due to the likelihood of becoming a public charge in the United States. Your original application for permanent residence was denied pursuant to Section 212 (a) (15) and (19). In your instant Motion you have sought to address the issue of public charge by submitting a new affidavit of support (Form I-134) from your daughter showing her annual income to be $9,776.00 in addition to the income previously shown on your son-in-law's Form I-134 of $14,200. The total available income of only approximately $24,000. must support in addition to yourself the affiants' three minor children. In addition you have submitted a letter from the \"Prudential Insurance Company\" confirming issuance of a supplementary Group Hospital Insurance Plan. In view of your advanced age a comprehensive medical insurance plan is paramount. The plan you have purchased is designed to supplement with small, fixed, daily dollar benefits any underlying basic medical expenses of even a modest hospitalization and provides no benefits at all for non-hospital medical costs. In view of the modest income and large number of dependents of your sponsors, it is unlikely that they could meet your expected medical expenses from their own resources. Moreover, you have not presented evidence of withdrawal of the application you made on 08/07/85 to the Massachusetts Department of Public Welfare for Federal Medicaid benefits to cover medical needs. Accordingly, we again conclude pursuant to Section 212 (a) (15) of the Act that you are likely to become a public charge in the United States and, thus are statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status to permanent resident. Sincerely, Charla Cobl Charles T. Cobb District Director"

This program is designed to prevent people from making a profit from health insurance by collecting more than the actual charge for their covered health care services. This practice eventually leads to increased costs of health care for all of us. COB regulates all benefit payments for covered services so that the total payments received from all insurance programs do not exceed the total charge for those covered services. WE will decide which plan should provide benefits first. The plan that provides benefits first is known as the primary plan. The primary plan is responsible for providing benefits to the full extent of their coverage. The plan that provides benefits next is known as the secondary plan. The secondary plan provides benefits towards any remaining balance of covered services as long as the payment. when added to the primary plan's payment. is not more than the total amount of the covered benefit expenses. HOW TO DETERMINE THE PRIMARY PLAN We will decide who is the primary and secondary plan by the same rules that are used throughout the insurance industry. Those rules are: A. If only one of the plans has COB, the plan that DOES NOT is the primary plan. B. When both plans have COB the rules listed below will apply: 1. If the patient is the subscriber under one plan and a covered dependent under another, the plan through which he or she is the subscriber is the primary plan. ge 18 2. If the patient is a covered dependent under the plan of both a male and a female subscriber, the male's plan is the primary plan."

Dorchester, MA. 02124 APR 15 1986 Dear Mrs. Petit: On December 3, 1985 you filed this Motion to Reconsider your application for adjustment of status to permanent resident (Form I-485) which was denied on November 8, 1985. within your submission you sent Form I-601 \"Application for Waiver of Grounds of Excludability\" on account of visa fraud pursuant to Section 212 (a) (19) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Your waiver application will be rejected and processed for a refund as you are not \"otherwise admissible\" as required by Section 212 (i) of the Act. Your application for permanent resident on reconsideration is, however, denied again under Section 212 (a) (15) of the Act due to the likelihood of becoming a public charge in the United States. Your original application for permanent residence was denied pursuant to Section 212( (a) (15) and (19). In your instant Motion you have sought to address the issue of public charge by submitting a new affidavit of support (Form I-134) from your daughter showing her annual income to be $9,776.00 in addition to the income previously shown on your son-in-law's Form I-134 of $14,200. The total available income of only approximately $24,000. must support in addition to yourself the affiants' three minor children. In addition you have submitted a letter from the \"Prudential Insurance Company\" confirming issuance of a supplementary Group Hospital Insurance Plan. In view of your advanced age a comprehensive medical insurance plan is paramount. The plan you have purchased is designed to supplement with small, fixed, daily dollar benefits any underlying basic medical expenses of even a modest hospitalization and provides no benefits at all for non-hospital medical costs. In view of the modest income and large number of dependents of your sponsors, it is unlikely that they could meet your expected medical expenses from their own resources. Moreover, you have not presented evidence of withdrawal of the application you made on 08/07/85 to the Massachusetts Department of Public Welfare for Federal Medicaid benefits to cover medical needs. Accordingly, we again conclude pursuant to Section 212(a)(15) of the Act that you are likely to become a public charge in the United States and, thus are statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status to permanent resident. Sincerely, Charls T. Cobb Charles T. Cobb District Director"

Your application will be denied pursaunt to Section 212 (a) (15) and (19), respectively referring to excludability due to the likelihood of becoming a public charge and for visa fraud. The record indicates that you are nearly 80 years of age, having been born in Haiti on December 1, 1905 and that you are not now, nor for the last five years have you been employed. To demonstrate financial support you submitted an Affidavit of Support (Form I-134) signed May 17, 1985 by your son-in-lew stating that he would support you based on his annual income of $13,500, his savings of 91990 and stocks and bonds worth $7, 776. In addition #your daughterythe petitioner, submitted FL job letter stating she was employed full-time in a clerical position, but no salary data was offered. Your daughter and son-in-law also reveal that they must support three minor children of their own. Since you are living with your daughter, the principal financial issue is security against medical expenses. You were asked at the interview to submit proof of comprehensive medical insurance to cover you in the United States. In reply you sent a Medicaid Verification Checklist\" dated August 7, 1985 from the Department of Public Welfare, 43 Hawkins Street, Boston, MA 02114 apparently constituting an application on your part for medicaid assistance from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Section 212(a)(15) of the Act provides for the exclusion of aliens from the United States \" who, in the opinion of the consular officer at the time of application for a visa, or in the opinion of the Attorney General at the time of application for admission, are likely at any time to become public charges\". Matter of Harutunian, 14 I&N Dec. 503, a precedent decision binding upon the Immigration Service concludes that: any alien who is incapable of earning U livelihood who does not have sufficient funds in the United States for his support, and has no person in the United States willing and able to assure that he will not need public support is excludable as likely to become a public charge whether or not the public support which will be available to him is reimbursable to the state. In all analysis right on point the decision goes on to state: \"Everything in the statutes, the legislative comments and the decisions points to one conclusion, that Congress intends that an applicant for a visa be excluded who is without sufficient funds to support himself, who has no one under any obligation to support him and who, being older, has an increasing chance of become dependent, disabled and sick\"."

    "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 8/11/2023 - 2 - Based on the foregoing, we conclude that you are an alien likely to become a public charge. In view of your age and lack of private medical insurance there is a very high probability that you will incur expensive pedical bills within the foreseable future that your sponsors simply could not afford to puy-out-of-yocket in view of their income and primary support obligations to their three children. While the District Director may, as a matter of discretion, allow your sponsors to post a Public Charge Bond in your behalf pursuant to Section 213 of the Act, such a bond to assure you would not become e public charge would be pointless since we are not questioning the good intentions of your sponsors but their inability to pay exborbitant but expected medical bills without insurance. The fact that you have apparently already applied for Medicaid, a publicly funded program to pay for the medical care of the indigent, underscores our analysis. The record further indicates that you entered the United States on December 30, 1984 as a \"B-2\" visitor based on a visa issued by the American Embassy in Port-au-Prince on December 13, 1984. At your sworn interview you insisted that you told the American Consul that you were coming only to \"visit\" the United States for a period of \"one year\". You denied that you had a preconceived intention which you concealed from the Consul to innigrate to the United States despite the fact that you came only with a one-way airline ticket and your actual application for permanent residence was filed only one month after your arrival here. You were completely unable to articulate any objective explanation of why you have chosen to remain in the United States with your daughter. A copy of yor nonimmigrant visa application has been obtained from the American Embassy and reveals that you did not request a stay of one year in the United States but only \"8 days\" (item #29) to come to \"Boston\" for \"tourism\" Section (212) (a) (19) of the Act provides for the exclusion of: 11 \"...Any alien who seeks to procure, or has sought to procure, or has procured a visa or other docurentation, or seeks to enter the United States, by fraud, or by willfully rd rropresenting EL material fact\". The definition exposition in case law precedents binding upon the Immigration Service concerning Section 212(a)(19) of the Immigration and Nationality Act is found in Matter of S & B-C 9 I & if Dec. 430. The case defines the materiality of a wisrepresentation. It is material if \"(A) the alien is excludable on the true facts, or (3) the misrepresentation tends to shut off u line of inquiry which is relevant to the alien's eligibility and which might well have resulted in a proper determination that he be excluded\". Had your true intention of seeking to remain indefinitely in the United States been known to the Consular Officer you would have been ineligible to receive a visitor's visa (Section 214(b) and Section 101(a)(15)(B) because you lacked a forei residence which you had no intention of abandoning and did not immediately qualify for an invigrant visa. By failing to admit what we now hold to be the true facts surrounding your waiver visitor's visa, you have also failed to avail yourself OI' the possibility of (Form I-601) pursuant to Section 212(1) of the Act. Accordingly you are statutorily ineligible for admission into the United States or for an immigrant visa due to your violation of Section 212(a)(19) of the Act."

If you enroll your family within one month of your first day of active work, or if you enroll your spouse within one month of your marriage, no medical examination is required. If you enroll your dependents after these dates, proof of their good health may be required. Effective Dates If you enroll your dependents within one month of your first day of active work, or if you enroll your spouse within one month of your marriage, their coverage will become effective on your first day of active work or the date of your marriage, providing you have authorized payroll deductions to begin. If you enroll your dependents or spouse after these dates, their coverage will be subject to the consent of the insurance company and will become effective on the day the insurance company accepts their proof of good health. Amount of Coverage For your dependents, the amount of coverage is determined by a multiple of your annual base rate of pay, depending on your spouse's age. Your annual base rate of pay is your basic annual salary or wage, including any sales or executive incen- tive pay, but not including overtime, shift premium, bonuses, or other forms of extra income. If your spouse is under 30, he or she will be covered under the highest benefit amount, or 100% of your annual pay. If your spouse is age 65 or older, he or she will be covered under the lowest benefit amount, or 40% of your annual pay. The maximum amount of coverage for your spouse is $100,000. Each eligible dependent child's amount of coverage will be equal to 25% of your annual base rate of pay. The maximum amount of coverage for each eligible dependent child is $25,000. 2 PUBLICATION NUMBER 59-7130, AUGUST, 1983"

Age of Spouse's Coverage Child's Coverage Spouse (multiple of employee's pay) Under 30 1.00 x 13,000 = $13,000 .25 X $13,000 = $3,250 30-34 .90 .25 35-39 .80 .25 40-44 .70 .25 45-49 .60 .25 50-64 .50 .25 65 and over .40 .25 Cost Your cost for Dependent Life Insurance is .20% of your monthly base rate of pay up to a maximum of $30 per month. Your monthly base rate in pay is your basic monthly salary or wage, including any sales or executive incentive pay, but not including overtime, shift premium, bonuses, or other forms of extra income. In the example above, the employee's cost for Dependent Life coverage is $2.17 per month.

If you enroll late, coverage will become effective on the day the insurance company accepts your proof of good health. Cost Your cost for Supplemental Life Insurance depends upon the type of coverage you choose. If you select High Option coverage, the cost will be .005 (one-half of one percent) of your monthly base rate of pay. Low Option coverage will cost .0025 (one-fourth of one percent) of your monthly base rate of pay. Monthly base rate of pay is your basic monthly salary or wage, including any sales or executive incentive pay, but not including overtime, shift premium, bonuses, or other forms of extra income. LIFE INSURANCE COVERAGE The amount of Supplemental Life Insurance coverage is determined according to the age group you are in and your annual base rate of pay. (To find your coverage, see the table in Amount of Coverage.) The amount of insurance will automatically be adjusted as your pay and age group change. Increases in the amount of insurance will become effective only when you are actively at work. If you continue to work after age 65, your Supplemental Life Insurance will continue in force. (See chart in Amount of Coverage.) If you are a retired employee who is rehired by the company you may reenroll in the Supplemental Life Insurance Plan. The amount of your insurance coverage can also be determined by using the table under Amount of Coverage. 2 PUBLICATION NUMBER 59-7123, JUNE, 1985"

    "full_text": "Screened by NARA, 8/11/2023 DECISION On May 1, 1985 you applied for adjustment of status to permanent residence (Form I-485) based on the visa petition of your United States Citizen daughter Mrs. Marie Magny approved on April 1, 1985 under Section 201(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. On July 24, 1985 accompanied and assisted by your son-in-law, you were interviewed under oath by an Immigration Examiner as to your eligibility for adjustment of status. Your application will be denied pursaunt to Section 212(a)(15) and (19), respectively referring to excludability due to the likelihood of becoming a public charge and for visa fraud. The record indicates that you are nearly 80 years of age, having been born in Haiti on December 1, 1905 and that you are not now, nor for the last five years have you been employed. To demonstrate financial support you submitted an Affidavit of Support (Form I-134) signed May 17, 1985 by your son-in-law stating that he would support you based on his annual income of $13,500, his savings of $1990 and stocks and bonds worth $7,776. In addition #your daughtersthe petitioner, submitted a job letter stating she was employed full-time in a clerical position, but no salary data was offered. Your daughter and son-in-law also reveal that they must support three minor children of their own. Since you are living with your daughter, the principal financial issue is security against medical expenses. You were asked at the interview to submit proof of comprehensive medical insurance to cover you in the United States. In reply you sent a \"Medicaid Verification Checklist\" dated August 7, 1985 from the Department of Public Welfare, 43 Hawkins Street, Boston, MA 02114 apparently constituting an application on your part for Medicaid assistance from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Section 212(a) (15) of the Act provides for the exclusion of aliens from the United States \" who, in the opinion of the consular officer at the time of application for a visa, or in the opinion of the Attorney General at the time of application for admission, are likely at any time to become public charges\". Matter of Harutunian, 14 I&N Dec. 583, a precedent decision binding upon the Immigration Service concludes that: any alien who is incapable of earning a livelihood who does not have sufficient funds in the United States for his support, and has no person in the United States willing and able to assure that he will not need public support is excludable as likely to become a public charge whether or not the public support which will be available to him is reimbursable to the state.\" \" In an analysis right on point the decision goes on to state: \"Everything in the statutes, the legislative comments and the decisions points to one conclusion, that Congress intends that an applicant for a visa be excluded who is without sufficient funds to support himself, who has no one under any obligation to support him and who, being older, has an increasing chance of become dependent, disabled and sick\"."

In view of your age and lack of private medical insurance there is a very high probability that you will incur expensive medical bills within the foreseable future that your sponsors simply could not afford to pay-out-of-pocket in view of their income and primary support obligations to their three children. While the District Director may, as a matter of discretion, allow your sponsors to post a Public Charge Bond in your behalf pursuant to Section 213 of the Act, such a bond to assure you would not become a public charge would be pointless since we are not questioning the good intentions of your sponsors but their inability to pay exhorbitant but expected medical bills without insurance. The fact that you have apparently already applied for Medicaid, a publicly funded program to pay for the medical care of the indigent, underscores our analysis. The record further indicates that you entered the United States on December 30, 1984 as a \"B-2\" visitor based on a visa issued by the American Embassy in Port-au-Prince on December 13, 1984. At your sworn interview you insisted that you told the American Consul that you were coming only to \"visit\" the United States for a period of \"one year\". You denied that you had a preconceived intention which you concealed from the Consul to immigrate to the United States despite the fact that you came only with a one-way airline ticket and your actual application for permanent residence was filed only one month after your arrival here. You were completely unable to articulate any objective explanation of why you have chosen to remain in the United States with your daughter. A copy of yor nonimmigrant visa application has been obtained from the American Embassy and reveals that you did not request a stay of one year in the United States but only \"8 days\" (item #29) to come to \"Boston\" for \"tourism\". Section (212) (a) (19) of the Act provides for the exclusion of: If Any alien who seeks to procure, or has sought to procure, or has procured a visa or other documentation, or seeks to enter the United States, by fraud, or by willfully misrepresenting a material fact\". The definition exposition in case law precedents binding upon the Immigration Service concerning Section 212(a)(19) of the Immigration and Nationality Act is found in Matter of S & B-C 9 I & N Dec. 436. The case defines the materiality of a misrepresentation. It is material if \"(A) the alien is excludable on the true facts, or (B) the misrepresentation tends to shut off a line of inquiry which is relevant to the alien's eligibility and which might well have resulted in a proper determination that he be excluded\". Had your true intention of seeking to remain indefinitely in the United States been known to the Consular Officer you would have been ineligible to receive a visitor's visa (Section 214(b) and Section 101(a)(15)(B) because you lacked a foreign residence which you had no intention of abandoning and did not immediately qualify for an immigrant visa. By failing to admit what we now hold to be the true facts surrounding your waiver visitor's visa, you have also failed to avail yourself of the possibility of (Form I-601) pursuant to Section 212(1) of the Act. Accordingly you are statutorily ineligible for admission into the United States or for an immigrant visa due to your violation of Section 212(a)(19) of the Act."

The notification, a copy of which is en- closed, states that you did not at any time receive documen- tation which had been previously requested. On August 7, 1987 I wrote a letter to travel control requesting additional time to submit the requested information. On October 6, 1987, when all the requested information was available, I wrote a letter to Travel Control enclosing the requested documentation. Copies of my letters are en- closed. In addition, the Motion to Reconsider contained other documentation in response to your earlier concerns. I am, therefore, asking that your recent decision be recon- sidered. If it is necessary for me to resubmit any of the documents mentioned above please let me know. Thank you for your consideration. Very truly yours, Gerald D. Wall Attorney GDW/mg Enclosures"

A signed copy of this document must be attached to each copy of any affidavit oi support submitted on behalf of an applicant. The Social Security Act, as amended, establishes certain requir ements for determining the eligibility of aliens for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Aid to Families with Depen- dent Children (AFDC) benefits. The Food Stamp Act, as amended contains similar provisions. These amendments require that the income and resources of a y person (and that person's spouse) who executes an affidavit of support or similar agreem nt on behalf of an immigrant alien, be deemed to be the income and resources of the alien nder formulas for determining eligibility for SSI, AFDC, and Food Stamp benefits during the three years following the alien's entry into the United States. The eligibility of aliens for SSI, AFDC, and Food Stamp benefits will be contingent upon their obtaining the cooperation of their sponsors in providing the necessary information and evi- dence to enable the Social Security Administration and/or State Welfare Agencies to carry out these provisions. An alien applying for SSI, AFDC, or Food Stamp benefits must make available to the Social Security Administration and/or State Welfare Agencies documentation concerning his income or resources or those of his sponsors, including information which he provided in support of his application for an immigrant visa or adjustment of status. The Secretary of Health and Human Services and/or State Welfare Agencies are authorized to obtain copies of any such documentation from other agencies. The Social Security Act and the Food Stamp Act also provide that an alien and his or her sponsor shall be jointly and severally liable to repay any SSI, AFDC, and Food Stamp benefits which are incorrectly paid because of misinformation provided by sponsor or because of sponsor's failure to provide information. Also, any incorrect payments of SSI and AFDC benefits which are not repaid will be withheld from any subsequent payments for which the alien or sponsors are otherwise eligible under the Social Security Act. These provisions do not apply to aliens admitted as refugees or granted political asylum by the Attorney General. They also will not apply to the SSI eligibility of aliens who become blind or disabled after entry into the United States. The AFDC provisions do not apply to aliens who are dependent children of the sponsor or sponsor's spouse. I, SHANTILAL MISTRY residing at 105 GREGORY AVE; APT 30 (name) (street and number) PASSAIC NJ 07055 acknowledge that I have read the above and am (City) (State) aware of my responsibilities as an immigrant sponsor under the Social Security Act, as amended, and the Food Stamp Act, as amended.

When grant of permanent residence becomes final, the copy returned by the Visa Control Office which allocates the visa number shall be appropriately endorsed, and placed in the filé. In such cases the triplicate copy, which was retained in the file, shall be noted to show the date permanent residence status is granted and forwarded to the State Director of Selective Service in the case of every male alien born on or after September 15, 1925, and who has reached 18 years of age. If not required for this purpose, it shall be destroyed. In cases where permanent residence is granted without referral to the Visa Control Office, except where Selective Service is to be notified, only an original 1-181 need be prepared and placed in the file. In other cases where outstanding instructions require the form -181 to be forwarded to the Visa Control Office, it shall be prepared in dup- licate and the original placed in the file, except when an additional copy is required to notify Selective Service. DISTIBICI PREFERENCE: Under Section 245, the priority date will be the filing date of one of the first six preference petitions. ACTION NONPREFERENCE: Under Section 245, the priority date shall be fixed by the following factors, whichever is the earliest; (1) the priority date accorded the applicant by the consular officer as a nonpreference immigrant; (2) the date on which application Form 1-485 is properly filed, if the applicant establishes that he is a member of a profession or a person with exceptional ability in the sciences or the arts not included in the Department of Labor's Schedule A (29 CFR 60) provided a certification is issued on that basis, or that he is within Schedule A, or that the provisions of Section 212(a)(14) of the Act do not apply to him; (3) the date on which an ap- proved valid third or sixth preference visa petition in his behalf was filed; or (4) the date an application for certification based on a job offer was accepted for processing by any office within the employment service system of the Department of Labor, provided the certification applied for was issued.

The specific purpose for which information is desired must be set forth. 2. CONSENT REQUIRED. The subject of a Service record may consent in writing to another person's obtaining information to which the subject would be entitled. A block is provided in the application form where such consent is shown. Information from visa petitions may be furnished upon application of the pe- titioner or beneficiary but an application by a third person requires the petitioner's written consent. 3. FEES. (a) Basic Charges. A single fee of $3.00 shall be charged for a search of the records of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The fee is required for the search and is not returnable. When the information requested relates to two or more persons, groups, or things, the search for each is a separate service and an additional fee or fees shall be submitted. In addition fees are chargeable for searching time or for monitoring time as prescribed by 8 CFR 103.7. Searching time, generally, is considered as covered by the basic fee of $3.00; however, additional charges shall be imposed for unusual requests that result in expenditure of considerable time. Charges for monitoring shall be assessed when the requester's examination requires assignment of an employee specifically for that purpose. (b) Copies and Certifications. A fee of 25 cents per page, with a minimum fee of 50 cents, shall be paid for copies of Service records but no charge (other than the basic search fee of $3.00) shall be required for the first page of a record. An additional fee of $1.00 is required for each certification of a true copy, with or without seal. For each attestation under seal an additional fee of $3.00 is required. The attestation is made by typing \"A COPY. ATTEST:\", and placing under this the signature and title of the attesting officer and affixing the seal. (c) Manner of Submission. If this application is mailed DO NOT SEND CASH. Attach a check or a United States postal money order (or, if outside the United States, an international money order) made pay- able to \"Immigration and Naturalization Service, Department of Justice.\" An applicant residing in the U.S. Virgin Islands shall make his remittance payable to \"Commissioner of Finance of the Virgin Islands\" and if residing in Guam to \"Treasurer, Guam.\" 4. CERTIFICATION OF NATURALIZATION RECORDS. A certification of any part of a court naturalization record, or of any certificate of naturalization or citizenship, may be obtained if required for compliance with any law, or if needed in any judicial proceeding. Application for such certification should include a statement of the relevant statute, or the nature of the judicial proceedings and the court in which pending. 5. NATURALIZATION RECORDS. If naturalization occurred prior to September 27, 1906, the subject's place of residence at the time of naturalization must be furnished. Such records rarely contain information regarding members of the naturalized person's family. 6. ARRIVAL RECORDS. Records of arrival prior to July 1, 1924 do not contain birthdates but merely show age stated at time of entry. 7. CERTIFICATE OF BIRTH DATA FROM IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION RECORDS. A certification of birth data from the records of this Service may be issued to foreign-born children under twenty-one years of age for a fee of $3.00. The parent, guardian or other adult having a legitimate interest in a person who is under fourteen years of age may file an application on such person's behalf.

Mail the original and one copy to the Visa Control Office When grant of permanent residence be- comes final, the copy returned by the Visa Control Office which allocates the visa number shall be appropriately endorsed, and placed in the file. In cases where permanent residence IS granted without réferral to the Visa Control Office only an original - -181 need be prepared and placed in the file. In other cases where outstanding instructions require the Form 181 to be forwarded to the Visa Control Office, it shall be prepared in dupli cate and the original placed in the file. OH Jala PREFERENCE: Under Section 245, the priority date will be the filing date of one of the first six preference petitions. NONPREFERENCE Under Section 245, the priority date shall be fixed by the following factors, whichever is the earliest; (1) the priority date accorded the applicant by the consular officer as a nonpreference immigrant; (2) the date on which application Form 1-485 is properly filed, if the applicant establishes that he is a member of a profession or a person with exceptional ability in the sciences or the arts not included in the Departn ent of Labor's Schedule A(29 CFR 60) provided a certification is issued on that basis, or that he is within Schedule A, or that the provisions of Section 212(a)(14) of the Act do not apply to him; (3) the date on which an ap- proved valid third or sixth preference visa petition in behalf was filed; or (4) the date an application for certification based on a job offer WIU accepted for processing by any office within the employment service system of the Depa nent of Labor, provided the certification applied for was issued. A nonpreference priority date, once established, is retained by the alien even though at the time a visa. number becomes available and he is allotted a nonpreference visa number he meets the provisions of Section 212(a)(14) of the Act by some means other than that by which he originally established entitlement to the nonpreference priority date. LABOR CERTIFICATION: Check and complete the block regarding certifications on the form as appropriate in a nonpreference case. REMARKS: If the visa number requested is based on Section 202(b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) or Section 203(a)(9) of the Act explain as appropriate in \"Remarks\" block. DELAY NOTICE: When the Service must obtain a visa number from the Department of State before granting permanent residence, the letter portion of this form notifying of the delay is mailed to the applicant with a copy to the attorney of record. In represented cases the attorney is notified of the approval of an application by furnishing him with a copy of the notice which is part of this form. presson CO' SPEST WASHINGTON LIVIT' FIEM III TRU UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Immiaration and Naturalization Service"

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE INSTRUCTIONS To obtain classifiable fingerprints: 1. Use printer's ink. 2. Distribute ink evenly on inking slab. 3. Wash and dry fingers thoroughly. 4. Roll fingers from nail to nail, and avoid allowing fingers to slip. 5. Be sure impressions are recorded in correct order. 6. If an amputation or deformity makes it impossible to print a finger, make a notation to that effect in the individual finger block. 7. If some physical condition makes it impossible to obtain perfect impressions, submit the best that can be obtained with a memo stapled to the card explaining the circumstances. 8. Examine the completed prints to see if they can be classified, bearing in mind the following: Most fingerprints fall into the patterns shown below (other patterns occur infrequently and are not shown here): 1. LOOP 2. WHORL 3. ARCH CENTER DELTAS OF LOOP DELTA THE LINES BETWEEN CENTER OF THESE LINES RUNNING BETWEEN ARCHES HAVE NO DELTAS LOOP AND DELTA MUST SHOW DELTAS MUST BE CLEAR (a) A delta (A) is the point at which the lines forming the loop or whorl pattern spread and begin going in different direc- tions. All loop prints have one delta. Whorl prints have two. (b) Loop prints cannot be classified unless the center of the loop and the delta, and THIS SPACE FOR FBI USE the lines between them, are clear. (c) Whorl prints cannot be classified unless the two deltas and the lines connecting the deltas are clear. (d) Arch fingerprints can be classified if a sufficiently clear impression is obtained to permit identification of the pattern as being an arch. 9. If, upon examination, it appears that any of the impressions cannot be classified, new prints should be made. If not more than three impressions are unclassifiable, new prints of these fingers may be taken and pasted over the defective ones. If more than three are unclassifiable, make a new chart.

Please note that the subject's certificate of naturalization No. 8-205-147, is not being submitted with the application inasmuch as he was admitted to citizenship on March 11, 1961, in the United States District Court at Boston. I believe that his original petition to file for naturalization is contained in your files. Your attention is called to the fact that the same petitioner previously filed a visa petition for the same wife at your offices. However, said petition had been filed by him in his paper name of Yee Nee Yon. It would be appreciated if the evidence offered in the former petition were made available in the instant matter.

It does not relieve him from meeting the other requirements of the immigration laws. Persons who have been convicted of or admit having committed a felony or other crime or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude either before or after entering the United States, other criminal, immoral, insane, mentally or phys- ically defective aliens, those afflicted with loath- some or contagious diseases, and others found to be inadmissible under the immigration laws are subject to exclusion if attempting to reenter, not- withstanding they may be in possession of permits to reenter. EFFECT OF ABSENCE FROM UNITED STATES UPON NATURALIZATION ELIGIBILITY: A permit to reenter does not relieve the person to whom issued from meeting the requirements of the naturalization laws. Notwithstanding the possession of a reentry permit, absence from the United States by an applicant for naturalization for a continuous period of one year or more during the period for which continuous residence in the United States is required for ad- mission to citizenship will break the continuity of such residence, except where, prior thereto, the Attorney General has approved an absence in the employment of, or under contract with, the United States Government or an American institution of research recognized as such by the Attorney General, or in the employment of an American firm or corporation engaged in whole or part in the development of foreign trade and commerce of the United States or a subsidiary thereof, more than 50 percent of whose stock is owned by an American firm or corporation, or in the employment of a public international organization of which the United States 14 0667224 0667224 15"

It does not relieve him from meeting the other requirements of the immigration laws. Persons who have been convicted of or admit having committed a felony or other crime or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude either before or after entering the United States, other criminal, immoral, insane, mentally or phys- ically defective aliens, those afflicted with loath- some or contagious diseases, and others found to be inadmissible under the immigration laws are subject to exclusion if attempting to reenier, not- withstanding they may be in possession of permits to reenter. EFFECT OF ABSENCE FROM UNITED STATES UPON NATURALIZATION ELIGIBILITY: A permit to reenter does not relieve the person to whom issued from meeting the requirements of the naturalization laws. Notwithstanding the possession of a reentry permit, absence from the United States by an applicant for naturalization for a continuous period of one year or more during the period for which continuous residence in the United States is required for ad- mission to citizenship will break the continuity of such residence, except where, prior thereto, the Attorney General has approved an absence in the employment of, or under contract with, the United States Government or an American institution of research recognized as such by the Attorney General, or in the employment of an American firm or corporation engaged in whole or part in the development of foreign trade and commerce of the United States or a subsidiary thereof, more than 50 percent of whose stock is owned by an American firm or corporation, or in the employment of a public international organization of which the United States 14 0421740 0421740 15"

She test that she dad departed from the U.S. sometime in 1933 and returned to the U.S. on 11/8/59. She stated that this absence was onlt to her native country of Ireland. App test that she had never voted in a foreign election, had never worked for a foreign government, had never served in the Armed Forces of a foreign country, had never taken an oath of allegiance to a foreign country, and had never obtained foreign natz. The State Dept file in her visa file ( A 10 775 863 ) reflects that App was held to have expatriated due to foreign residence. The U.S. Supreme Court in Schneider V. Rusk in May of 1964 held this to be unconstitutional. As no other grounds for expatriation is indicated, it appears that App has not been expatriated. In accordance with instructions contained in NE Memo of 7/9/64, a new N.C. was issued. App subsequently married and has surrended her old cert and a new one in her marriage was issued her this day.

Mrs. Margaret O'Neill, 829 Hyde Park Avenue, Hyde Park, Boston 36, Mass. Dear Mrs. O'Neill: The receipt is acknowledged of your letter dated June 22, 1964, requesting the Embassy to forward to you the certificate of loss of United States nationality in your case, which contains information regarding your acquisition of American citizenship. Your citizenship file at this office shows that you were naturalized before the Supreme Court of the State of New York at Long Island City, New York, on November 30, 1932, in your maiden name, Margaret Horgan. Certificate of Naturalization number 3645015 was issued to you. You were issued passport number 30184 in your maiden name, by the Department of State on June 8, 1933. You lost your American nationality under Section 404(b) of the Nationality Act of 1940 by residing continuously in Ireland, the country of your birth, for a period of three years. The effective date of loss was October 15, 1946. A certificate of loss of nationality in your name, dated, July 30, 1957, was approved by the Department of State on August 13, 1957. A copy of the approved certificate of loss was forwarded to you from the American Consulate at Cork on September 3, 1957. The Embassy does not, therefore, have a copy to forward to you at this time. In view of the recent decision made by the Supreme Court of the United States in the Schneider v.Rusk case, it appears that you may regain your American citizenship. It is believed that the information contained in this letter will be of assistance to you in this matter. Sincerely yours, For the Charge d'Affaires a.i., theore American Kiyonao Consul Okami Heame"

    "full_text": "INSTRUCTIONS GENERAL: To request allocation of a visa number for a preference or nonpreference case under Section 245 or for a Western Hemisphere number under Section 1 of the Act of November 2, 1966, mail original and one copy to Visa Control Office. When grant of permanent residence becomes final, the copy returned by the Visa Control Office which allocates the visa number shall be appropriately endorsed, and placed in the file. In such cases the triplicate copy, which was re- tained in the file, shall be noted to show the date permanent residence status is granted and for- warded together with completed Form I-59 to the State Director of Selective Service in the case of every male alien between the ages 18 and 26 or between the ages of 18 and 35 in the case of a doctor, dentist or other medical specialist. If not required for this purpose, it shall be destroyed. In cases where permanent residence is granted without referral to the Visa Control Office, except where Selective Service is to be notified, only an original 1 - 181 need be prepared and placed in the file. In other cases where outstanding instructions require the form 1 - 181 to be forwarded to the Visa Control Office, it shall be prepared in duplicate and the original placed in the file, except when an additional copy is required to notify Selective Service. PREFERENCE: Under Section 245, the priority date will be the filing date of one of the first six preference petitions. NONPREFERENCE: Under Section 245, the priority date shall be fixed by the following factors, whichever is the earliest; (1) the priority date accorded the applicant by the consular officer as a nonpreference immigrant; (2) the date on which application Form 1-485 is properly filed, if the applicant establishes that he is a member of a profession or a person with exceptional ability in the sciences or the arts not included in the Department of Labor's Schedule A(29 CFR 60) provided a certification is issued on that basis, or that he is within Schedule A, or that the provisions of Section 212(a)(14) of the Act do not apply to him; (3) the date on which an ap- proved valid third or sixth preference visa petition in his behalf was filed; or (4) the date an application for certification based on a job offer was accepted for processing by any office within the employment service system of the Department of Labor, provided the certification applied for was issued. A nonpreference priority date, once established, is retained by the alien even though at the time a visa number becomes available and he is allotted a nonpreference visa number he meets the provisions of Section 212(a)(14) of the Act by some means other than that by which he originally established entitlement to the nonpreference priority date. LABOR CERTIFICATION: Check and complete the block regarding certifications on the form as appropriate in a nonpreference case. REMARKS: IF the visa number requested is based on Section 202(b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) or Section 203(a)(9) of the Act explain as appropriate in \"Remarks\" block. DELAY NOTICE: When the Service must obtain a visa number from the Department of State before granting permanent residence, the letter portion of this form notifying of the delay is mailed to the applicant with a copy to the attorney of record. In represented cases the attorney is notified of the approval of an application by furnishing him with a copy of the notice which is part of form. yelco TOOS CUTCHEO"

It also appears that some of the records concerning Declaration of Intentions have been lost. By going page by page in the minute book and using your information, I found a judgment. I have not found all the information required because I am unable to locate the papers. The manner in which papers were filed in 1892 requires one without any index memoranda to go file by file to locate it. If you write me it is necessary to find the original petition and any other papers that might be filed in the case, I will do so on your notice. Even the fee and docket book for this time has been lost and I am not aware what papers were filed in this case. Sincerely, Robert E. Dorough RED:fs"

On November 9, 2009, and February 22, 2010, you appeared for an interview on your N-400. Pursuant to the investigation and examination of your application, it is deemed that you are ineligible for naturalization because you have not met the English and/or history requirements as set forth in Section 312 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1423. Section 312 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. $1423, states, in pertinent part: (a) No person except as otherwise provided in this title shall hereafter be naturalized as a citizen of the United States upon his own application who cannot demonstrate - (1) an understanding of the English language, including an ability to read, write, and speak words in ordinary usage in the English language: Provided, That the requirements of this paragraph relating to ability to read and write shall be met if the applicant can read or write simple words and phrases to the end that a reasonable test of his literacy shall be made and that no extraordinary or unreasonable conditions shall be imposed upon the applicant; and (2) a knowledge and understanding of the fundamentals of the history, and of the principles and form of government, of the United States. (b) (1) The requirements of subsection (a) shall not apply to any person who is unable because of physical or developmental disability or mental impairment to comply therewith.

The loss of any cognitive abilities based on the direct effects of the illegal use of drugs will not be considered in determining whether a person is unable to demonstrate an understanding of the English language. For purposes of this paragraph, the term medically determinable means an impairment that results from anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities which can be shown by medically acceptable clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques to have resulted in functioning so impaired as to render an individual unable to demonstrate an understanding of the English language as required by this section, or that renders the individual unable to fulfill the requirements for English proficiency, even with reasonable modifications to the methods of determining English proficiency as outlined in paragraph (c) of this section. Title 8, Code of Federal Regulations, § 312.2, states, in pertinent part: (a) General. No person shall be naturalized as a citizen of the United States upon his or her own application unless that person can demonstrate a knowledge and understanding of the fundamentals of the history, and of the principles and form of government, of the United States. A person who is exempt from the literacy requirement under § 312.1(b)(1) and (2) must still satisfy this requirement. (b) Exceptions (1) The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to any person who is unable to demonstrate a knowledge and understanding of the fundamentals of the history, and of the principles and form of government of the United States because of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, that already has or is expected to last at least 12 months. The loss of any cognitive skills based on the direct effects of the illegal use of drugs will not be considered in determining whether an individual may be exempted. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term medically determinable means an impairment that results from anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities which can be shown by medically acceptable clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques to have resulted in functioning so impaired as to render an individual to be unable to demonstrate the knowledge required by this section or that renders the individual unable to participate in the testing procedures for naturalization, even with reasonable modifications. On December 8, 2008 and February 22, 2010 you submitted Forms N-648 for Agency consideration (Medical Certification for Disability Exceptions). The first adjudicating officer reviewed your N-648 and determined that you are not eligible for an exception, and requested additional information with regard to your N-648. The second adjudicating officer reviewed your second opinion and determined your N-648 insufficient. The doctor diagnosed you to have heart disease, arthritis and limited vision. These conditions are not considered to be qualifying disabilities as stated in the Code of Federal Regulations 312.2(b). Furthermore, he did not explain in detail the connection between the findings and your inability to learn English and U.S. history and civics. For the above reason(s), you are deemed ineligible for an exception from the requirements of section 312 of the INA. Accordingly, your application may not be approved, and is hereby denied."

An agency may not conduct or sponsor an information collection and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. We try to create forms and instructions that are accurate and easily understood, and that impose the least possible burden on you to provide us with information. Often this is difficult because some immigration laws are very complex. Accordingly, the reporting burden for this collection of information is computed as follows: 1) learning about the form, 30 minutes; 2) completing the form, 60 minutes; and 3) assembling and filing the application, 30 minutes, and an estimated average of 120 minutes per response. If you have any comments regarding the accuracy of this estimate or suggestions for making this form simpler, write to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Regulatory Management Division, 111 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20529, OMB No. 1615-0060.

To be resettled in the United States as a refugee, an applicant must meet the statutory definition of refugee contained in section 101 (a) (42) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), as amended. Refugee status can be approved only if the applicant establishes a credible claim of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Additionally, all applicants for refugee status in the United States must establish that they are not precluded from entry into the United States under other sections of law. During your interview with an Officer of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), your claim to having been persecuted or having a well-founded fear of persecution was reviewed. At that time, you were given the opportunity to present evidence, documentation, and/or an accumulation of detail through verbal testimony of the events or circumstances which support you claim of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution. After carefully reviewing your account of these events and surrounding circumstances, it has been determined that you do not qualify for refugee status because of the reason(s) checked below: The events, action (s) and surrounding circumstances set forth by you in your application and developed during the interview do not constitute persecution within the meaning of U.S. immigration law. The events, action(s) and surrounding circumstances set forth by you in your application and developed during the interview do not support your claim of a well-founded (i.e., \"reasonable\") fear of persecution within the meaning of U.S. immigration law. You have not established that the actions taken against you, or those which you fear may be taken against you due to your race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion."
